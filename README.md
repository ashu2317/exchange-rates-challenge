# Exchange Rates Challenge

## Requirements, Rules, Guide:
- No cheating - it doesn't benefit you.
- Let's have fun, don't take it too seriously. Aim is to learn and to push yourself.
-  Each challenge will build upon the previous one.
-  You'll need have a GitHub account.
-  We will start slow/small and will build up as we go along.
-  No time limit will be applied - but maybe we should have some form of agreement - maybe we DO set time.
-  Use the slack channels for help - we will support each other.

## Challenge Business Brief:
Build a service that will expose a way to convert currencies. For example convert 10.99 GBP to AED. 
For the sake of simplicity we will limit the number of currencies to AED, EUR, GBP, INR, PKR and USD. 

## What you need

- Travis account (https://travis-ci.org)
